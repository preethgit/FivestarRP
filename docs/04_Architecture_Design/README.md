## Design Principles

### Architectural Principles

- **Microservices:** Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **Cloud-Native:** Built for AWS cloud platform
- **API-First:** All interactions through well-defined APIs
- **Security by Design:** Security integrated throughout architecture

### Design Patterns

- **CQRS:** Command Query Responsibility Segregation for complex operations
- **Event Sourcing:** For audit trail and state reconstruction
- **Circuit Breaker:** For resilient external integrations
- **Saga Pattern:** For distributed transaction management

## Integration Architecture

### External Integrations

- **LMS (FinnOne):** Via MuleSoft API Gateway
- **Banking Partners:** RBL, KOTAK, SBI, IDFC, Yes Bank
- **Payment Processors:** RazorPay, JusPay
- **HRMS:** DarwinBox for user authentication

### Internal Components

- **Internal Payments Engine:** Staff portal and operations
- **Customer Payment Portal:** Public-facing payment interface
- **Shared Services:** Authentication, logging, monitoring
