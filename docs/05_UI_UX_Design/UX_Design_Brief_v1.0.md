## Feature 2: Cash Collection Management

#### Screen(s) / View(s)

- Field Collection Entry
- Receipt Generation
- OTP Verification
- Daily Collection Reconciliation (DCR)
- Daily Balancing Statement (DBS)

##### User Stories / Key Scenarios

- As a Field Officer, I want to collect payment from a customer and generate a receipt with OTP verification so that the transaction is properly recorded.

- As a Branch Cashier, I want to review and confirm field collections so that they can be posted to LMS.
- As a Branch Manager, I want to view the daily collection summary so I can monitor branch performance.
- As a Finance Team Member, I want to reconcile all cash collections against LMS postings to ensure accuracy.

##### Key Functionality & Requirements

- Mobile-optimized collection entry with customer verification

- OTP-based transaction confirmation with retry options
- Receipt generation with unique identifiers
- Branch confirmation workflow for field collections
- Daily reconciliation with approval workflow
- Support for manual allocation and auto-allocation

##### UI/UX Considerations & Design Details

- **User Goals & Tasks:** Enable quick, accurate collection recording while ensuring verification and compliance.

- **Information Architecture:** Organize the collection process as a step-by-step flow with clear progress indicators.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show only essential fields initially, with advanced options available through expansion.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Emphasize payment amount, customer details, and verification status with appropriate typography and color.
- **Affordances & Signifiers:** Clear action buttons for each step of the process with appropriate visual weight.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent layout and interaction patterns between field collection and in-branch collection workflows.
- **Accessibility (A11y):** High contrast text for outdoor visibility, screen reader support for all functions.
- **Error Prevention & Handling:** Amount validation, duplicate payment detection, and clear error recovery paths.
- **Feedback:** Real-time status updates for OTP verification, receipt generation, and LMS posting.
- **Performance:** Optimize for low-bandwidth scenarios with minimal data transfer requirements.
- **Device Considerations:** One-handed operation for field officers using phones. Desktop-optimized views for branch staff.
- **Microcopy:** Clear, actionable instructions at each step, with confirmation language that builds confidence.
- **Animations:** Subtle loading animations during processing, success animations for completed steps.
- **State Handling:** Distinct offline collection mode with clear visual indicators. Empty state for new collection days.
- **Interaction Design:** Large touch targets for field use, potentially in difficult lighting conditions.
- **Focus Management:** Numeric keypad focus for amount entry, minimal tab stops for efficiency.
- **Component Design:** Purpose-built collection components that work across devices and connectivity states.
- **Content Adaptability:** Responsive layouts that prioritize critical information at all screen sizes.
- **i18n/l10n:** Support for regional currency formats and number systems.
- **Onboarding/Discoverability:** Contextual hints for first-time users explaining the collection process.
- **Permissions:** Clear explanation for camera (OTP capture), location (verification), and notification permissions.
- **Offline/Connectivity:** Full offline collection capability with transparent sync status and queue management.
- **State Persistence:** Save draft collections if interrupted, with clear resumption path.
- **Haptic Feedback:** Confirmation feedback for successful collection and receipt generation.
- **Other Notes:** Consider environmental factors like bright sunlight and potential distractions for field users.

##### Success Metrics

- 99% first-attempt success rate for OTP verification

- 100% traceability between collection and LMS posting
- 50% reduction in reconciliation time

##### Open Questions / Points for Discussion

- Should we allow partial collections or only full EMI amounts?

- What additional verification should be required for large payment amounts?

## User Journey Maps

### Key Journeys to Design For

1. **Field Officer Collection Process**
   - Loan verification → Amount entry → OTP verification → Receipt generation → Confirmation → (Later) Viewing posting status

2. **Branch Cashier End-of-Day Process**
   - Review pending collections → Verify details → Confirm posting → Generate DCR/DBS → Submit for approval

3. **Digital Payment Reconciliation**
   - Review incoming payments → Match with loan accounts → Handle exceptions → Confirm posting → Generate reconciliation report

4. **UPI Mandate Registration**
   - Customer verification → UPI ID entry → Penny drop verification → Name matching → Supervisor approval → Mandate confirmation

5. **System Administrator Monitoring**
   - View system status → Identify issues → Configure retries → Monitor queue → Handle exceptions → View performance metrics

## Technical Considerations

The design will need to account for key technical aspects:

1. **Microservice Architecture**
   - UX should reflect clear domain boundaries while presenting a unified experience
   - Plan for component reuse across services
   - Consider state management between microservices

2. **Cloud-Native Deployment**
   - Design for auto-scaling and high availability
   - Account for potential regional variations in performance
   - Plan for graceful degradation when services are updating

3. **API-First Approach**
   - Design should anticipate asynchronous operations
   - Create appropriate loading and transition states
   - Consider optimistic UI updates with confirmation

4. **Mobile-Optimized Experience**
   - Progressive enhancement approach
   - Touch-friendly interface elements
   - Offline-first capabilities for field operations

## Implementation Priorities

The UX implementation will follow a phased approach aligned with the development roadmap:

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Months 1-2)

- Design system establishment
- Authentication experience
- Basic navigation patterns
- Core form components

### Phase 2: Payment Collection Essentials (Months 2-3)

- Cash collection workflows
- Receipt generation
- Basic reporting
- LMS integration status

### Phase 3: Digital Payments & Mandates (Months 3-5)

- RazorPay integration
- UPI AutoPay workflows
- NACH mandate management
- Digital reconciliation

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Months 5-7)

- Comprehensive reporting
- Analytics dashboards
- System monitoring
- Performance optimization

## Success Criteria

The redesigned Payments Engine UX will be considered successful if it achieves:

1. **Efficiency Improvements**
   - 40% reduction in time to complete key workflows
   - 60% reduction in training time for new users
   - 50% reduction in manual reconciliation effort

2. **Error Reduction**
   - 90% reduction in data entry errors
   - 95% reduction in reconciliation discrepancies
   - 100% transaction traceability

3. **User Satisfaction**
   - System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 80+
   - 90% positive feedback from field officers
   - 85% reduction in support tickets related to user experience

4. **Business Impact**

1. **Early Discovery**
   - Contextual interviews with all user roles
   - Observation of current workflows
   - Pain point analysis

2. **Iterative Testing**
   - Rapid prototyping of key workflows
   - Usability testing with representative users
   - Feedback incorporation

3. **Validation**
   - A/B testing of critical interactions
   - Pilot deployment with selected branches
   - Analytics instrumentation

## Design Deliverables

The UX design phase will produce:

1. **UX Strategy & Principles**
   - User personas and journeys
   - Information architecture
   - Interaction principles

2. **Design System**
