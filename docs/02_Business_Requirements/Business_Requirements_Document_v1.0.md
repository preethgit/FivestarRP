## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview

Fivestar Business Finance has engaged 1CloudHub to modernize their Payments Engine, transitioning from a legacy monolithic system to a cloud-native microservices architecture deployed on AWS. This transformation aims to enhance operational efficiency, improve payment processing accuracy, support integration with multiple payment channels, and ensure scalability for future business growth.

### 1.2 Business Justification

The current payment functionality exists as a module within a legacy monolithic application that faces challenges including manual workflows, limited integration capabilities, and potential scaling constraints. The modernized Payments Engine will support various payment channels including cash collections, digital payments via RazorPay and BBPS, UPI AutoPay, and NACH mandates.

### 1.3 Scope Summary

This project will deliver a comprehensive payment processing platform built on modern technologies (.NET Core, React.js) deployed on AWS cloud infrastructure. Key features include secure authentication, role-based access control, efficient cash collection workflows, digital payment integration, automated mandate management, robust error handling, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

### 1.4 Investment Summary

The implementation will follow a phased approach over 7-8 months to minimize business disruption, with parallel run capabilities to ensure uninterrupted operations.

## 2. Project Background

### 2.1 Business Context

Fivestar Business Finance is a leading Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) in India specializing in providing loans to underserved segments. Their primary focus is on Loan Against Property (LAP) under Business Finance, with an additional legacy portfolio of Home Loans (HL). As Fivestar continues to grow, the company faces increasing volumes of loan repayments through various channels, creating a need for a more efficient and scalable payment processing system.

### 2.2 Problem Statement

The existing payment engine operates as part of an ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework 4.6.1) with the following challenges:

1. **Cash Dominance**: A significant volume of payments is still handled in cash at branch locations, requiring multiple touchpoints and increasing the risk of manual errors or fraud.

2. **Fragmented Systems**: There is no centralized platform to initiate, monitor, or reconcile payments. Each payment mode (cash, cheque, UPI, NACH) follows a different workflow with limited integration.

3. **Manual Processes**: Many workflows rely on manual intervention, including field collection verification, cash handling, DCR/DBS preparation, and mandate registration.

4. **Limited Visibility**: Status tracking lacks real-time visibility, with branches relying on post-transaction confirmations or phone follow-ups with operations teams.

5. **Manual Reconciliation**: Reconciliation of payments with bank records and LMS entries is performed using Excel sheets, increasing workload and the risk of mismatches.

6. **Resilience Issues**: The system faces challenges during LMS downtime, leading to potential data loss or duplicate transactions.

### 2.3 Opportunity Description

This modernization project will enable:

- Streamlined payment operations across all channels
- Enhanced customer experience through digital payment options
- Improved operational efficiency through automation
- Better risk management through real-time monitoring
- Scalable infrastructure to support business growth

### 2.4 Strategic Alignment

This project aligns with Fivestar's digital transformation strategy and supports their goal of becoming a technology-forward NBFC capable of serving customers efficiently across diverse geographic and demographic segments.
