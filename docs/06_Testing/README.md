## Testing Strategy

### Test Levels

1. **Unit Testing** - 80% code coverage minimum
2. **Integration Testing** - Component and system integration
3. **System Testing** - End-to-end business scenarios  
4. **User Acceptance Testing** - Business stakeholder validation
5. **Performance Testing** - Load, stress, and scalability
6. **Security Testing** - Vulnerability and penetration testing

### Test Types
