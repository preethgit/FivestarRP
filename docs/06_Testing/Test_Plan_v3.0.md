## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Test Plan document provides comprehensive testing strategy, test cases, and procedures for validating the Fivestar Payments Engine modernization project. The testing covers both the Internal Payments Engine (PE) and Customer Payment Portal components.

### 1.2 Scope

The test plan covers:

- **Internal Payments Engine**: Authentication, Admin, DCR/DBS, Digital Payments, AutoPay Mandates, LMS Resilience, Reporting, Scheduled Jobs
- **Customer Payment Portal**: Loan Verification, Payment Processing, UI/UX, Security
- **Integration Testing**: API integrations, LMS connectivity, Banking partners
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Performance, Security, Reliability, Scalability
- **Acceptance Testing**: Business acceptance criteria validation

### 1.3 Test Objectives

1. **Functional Validation**: Verify all functional requirements are implemented correctly
2. **Integration Validation**: Ensure seamless integration between components and external systems
3. **Performance Validation**: Confirm system meets performance benchmarks
4. **Security Validation**: Validate security controls and compliance requirements
5. **User Experience Validation**: Ensure usability and accessibility standards
6. **Business Process Validation**: Confirm business workflows operate as designed

---

## 2. Test Scope

### 2.1 In Scope
